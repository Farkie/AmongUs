## Visible tasks

Visible tasks are tasks that can be seen by another player to verify that the person on the task is innocent.

### The skeld

4 visible tasks: medbay scanner, turrets in weapons and rubbish shoot in storage which will always be visable. As well as shields which will only be visable the first time someone does it.

### Mira hq

1 visible task: medbay scanner.

### Polus

2 visible tasks: medbay scanner and turrets

## Vents

Vents can only be used by imposters, if you see someone jump in or out of one they are definitely an imposter.

### Skeld

The vents from electrical goes to medbay and security.
Vent from shields goes to the lower one in nav.
Vent from weapons goes to the upper one in nav.
Vent from cafeteria goes to admin and corridor near nav.

### Mira HQ

all vents go to all other vents.

## Emergency button

This is the big button in cafeteria, it calls a meeting so everyone can chat.
This can be used by each player one time.
If you see something suspicious like someone venting you can press this button and tell everyone what you saw.
Pressing the button will also reset the imposters kill cool down.

## Special activities (???)

activities you anyone can do on each map

### The skeld

In the admin room you can approach the left side of the table at which point you will get a prompt to use the table, this will show you a map of how many people are in each room. It only shows rooms so will not show you people is in corridors. This is can be useful to use because if someone hasn't left a room for a long time it might be because they are dead, so you can go and check up on them.

In the security room you can approach the security cameras and view them. There are 4 of them dotted around the map.
Outside nav, outside admin outside the security room and one outside medbay.
There cameras will have a red light flash on them if they are in use, so imposters should pay attention to if someone is watching when they make a kill.
